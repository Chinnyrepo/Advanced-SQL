#  Advanced SQL ----- Advanced queries

1. For each invoice that has PaymentDate (not null), calculate and display how many days before 
   the due date the invoice was paid. More specifically, display invoiceID, invoice number, invoice date,
   invoice due date, payment date, and calculated column that is the number of days from payment date to 
   due date (this column should have positive values where invoice was paid before due date, and negative
   if it was paid after due date). Display all date values without time component. 
   Make sure all columns have meaningful headers.

   SELECT InvoiceID, InvoiceNumber, convert(date,InvoiceDate) AS InvoiceDate, 
   convert(date,InvoiceDueDate) AS InvoiceDueDate, convert(date,PaymentDate) AS PaymentDate, 
   datediff(day, InvoiceDueDate,PaymentDate) as PaymentDateToDueDate 
   FROM Invoices
   WHERE PaymentDate is not null;

2. Using InvoiceLineItems, display invoice ids together with how many lines each invoice has. Include only 
   invoices that have more than one line. Make sure all columns have meaningful headers.

   SELECT InvoiceID, count(*) AS InvoiceCount FROM InvoiceLineItems 
   GROUP BY InvoiceID HAVING count(*) >1

3. Add InvoiceNumber and VendorName to the previous query (you will need to join two more tables).

   SELECT Inv.InvoiceID, count(*) AS InvoiceCount, I.InvoiceNumber, V.VendorName
   FROM InvoiceLineItems AS Inv join Invoices AS I ON Inv.InvoiceID = I.InvoiceID
   join Vendors AS V on I.VendorID = V.VendorID
   GROUP BY Inv.InvoiceID,I.InvoiceNumber, V.VendorName
   HAVING count(*) > 1

4. Display account numbers and descriptions of all accounts from GLAccounts table that are NOT referenced by any invoice line item.

   SELECT AccountNo, AccountDescription
   FROM GLAccounts
   WHERE AccountNo not in (select distinct AccountNo from InvoiceLineItems)
   GROUP BY AccountNo, AccountDescription

5. For each vendor who has invoices display vendor ID, vendor name and the date of the most recent invoice of that vendor.
   Display all date values without time component. Make sure all columns have meaningful headers.

   SELECT Vendors.VendorID, VendorName, convert(date, max(InvoiceDate)) as ConvertInvoiceDate
   FROM Vendors join Invoices on Vendors.VendorID = Invoices.VendorID
   WHERE Vendors.VendorID in (select VendorID from Invoices)
   GROUP BY Vendors.VendorID, VendorName
